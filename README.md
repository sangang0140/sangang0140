### 🌟 About Me
I’m an AI educator and developer based in **Gwangju, South Korea**,  
focused on integrating **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **AI automation** into real-world education.  
As the CEO of **Beum & Chaeum (비움과 채움)**, I design AI literacy programs and mentor teachers and students on creative AI use.  

I recently developed an educational demo project:  
👉 [LangChain + LangGraph Exam Report Automation](https://github.com/sangang0140/langchain-exam-demo)  

It demonstrates how LangChain can generate personalized student reports automatically  
and shows how AI can support meaningful learning experiences.
